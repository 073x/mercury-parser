Too much government interference could hamstring industry innovation and prove expensive to manufacturers and consumers, he warned.</p><p score="4">But those pleas didn&apos;t appear to elicit much support from commissioners at a public hearing on the proposed rules that would set maximum energy-consumption standards for televisions to be phased in over two years beginning in January 2011. A vote could come as early as Nov. 4.</p></div></div><div id="mod-a-body-after-first-para" class="mod-latarticlesarticletextwithadcpc mod-latarticlesarticletext mod-articletext" score="109.725"><p score="6">The association&apos;s views weren&apos;t shared by everyone in the TV business. Representatives of some TV makers, including top-seller Vizio Inc. of Irvine, said they would have little trouble complying with tighter state standards without substantially increasing prices.</p><p score="4.02">&quot;We&apos;re comfortable with our ability to meet the proposed levels and implementation dates,&quot; said Kenneth R. Lowe, Vizio&apos;s co-founder and vice president.</p><p score="5.64">Last month, the commission formally unveiled its proposal to require manufacturers to limit television energy consumption in a way that has been done with refrigerators, air conditioners and dozens of other products since the 1970s.</p><p score="7">&quot;We would not propose TV efficiency standards if we thought there was any evidence in the record that they will hurt the economy,&quot; said Commissioner Julia Levin, who has been in charge of the two-year rule-making procedure. &quot;This will actually save consumers money and help the California economy grow and create new clean, sustainable jobs.&quot;</p><p score="5.04">Tightening efficiency ratings by using new technology and materials should result in &quot;zero increase in cost to consumers,&quot; said Harinder Singh, an Energy Commission staffer on the TV regulation project.</p><p score="5">California&apos;s estimated 35 million TVs and related electronic devices account for about 10% of all household electricity consumption, the Energy Commission staff reported. But manufacturers quickly are coming up with new technologies that are making even 50-inch-screen models much more economical to operate.</p><p score="7.88">New features, such as light-emitting diodes that consume tiny amounts of power, special reflective films and sensors that automatically adjust TV brightness to a room&apos;s viewing conditions, are driving down electricity consumption, experts said.</p><p score="6.2">The payoff could be big for TV owners, said Ken Rider, a commission staff engineer. Average first-year savings from reduced electricity use would be an estimated $30 per set and $912 million statewide, he said.</p><p score="7">If all TVs met state standards, Rider added, California could avoid the $600-million cost of building a natural-gas-fired power plant. Switching to more-efficient TVs could have an estimated net benefit to the state of $8.1 billion, the commission staff reported.</p><p score="10">Consumer Electronics Assn. officials disputed that figure, arguing that it was based on out-of-date numbers that fail to account for recent industry innovations. &quot;With voluntary compliance, manufacturers can meet the targets over time, managing the cost impact, yet not in any way impeding innovation,&quot; said Seth Greenstein, an association consultant.</p><p score="0">--</p><p score="0"><a href="mailto:marc.lifsher@latimes.com">marc.lifsher@latimes.com</a></p></div></div>
